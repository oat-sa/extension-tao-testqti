    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Chance Vought F4U Corsair</strong> was a carrier-capable fighter aircraft
    that saw service primarily in World War II and the Korean War. Demand
    for the aircraft soon overwhelmed Vought's manufacturing capability,
    resulting in production by Goodyear and Brewster: Goodyear-built Corsairs
    were designated <strong>FG</strong> and Brewster-built aircraft <strong>F3A</strong>.
    From the first prototype delivery to the U.S. Navy in 1940, to final delivery in 1953
    to the French, 12,571 F4U Corsairs were manufactured by Vought,[1] in 16 separate models,
    in the longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U.S. history (1942–53).€</p>
